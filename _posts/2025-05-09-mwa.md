*This started with a textbook sentence and turned into a full-blown simulation rabbit hole.* 
*I’m being completely transparent about my very silly mistakes here lol — learn from them and maybe laugh a little too.* 
### So, what even is microwave ablation? 
Imagine you're trying to kill a tumor, but instead of slicing it out with a scalpel or flooding your body with chemotherapy, you send in **microwaves** to heat it up until it dies. That, in essence, is **microwave ablation (MWA)**. It's like targeted, internal cooking — only the steak is a tumor and you're the chef with a background in electromagnetics. 
Microwave ablation is part of a family of thermal therapies used to kill unwanted tissue by raising its temperature to around **60°C** or higher. Beyond this, cells start breaking down, blood flow shuts off, and the tumor becomes toast — literally. 
### Why microwaves? 
Well, first off: microwaves aren't just for soggy pizza. They're **high-frequency electromagnetic waves** that heat water-containing tissue by agitating water molecules. And guess what? **Tumors are water-rich**, so they're basically microwave magnets. This makes them ideal for selective heating. 
Other reasons we love microwaves: 
* They penetrate tissue better than lasers. 
* They heat faster than RF ablation. 
* They don't require as much contact as ultrasound. 
### Why 2.45 GHz? 
This isn’t just a random number — 2.45 GHz is part of the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) band. That means you can actually use it in medical devices without getting into a regulatory mess. But more than that, 2.45 GHz offers a sweet spot: it's high enough to produce localized heating, but still penetrates tissue a few centimeters deep. If I went too high (like millimeter wave), it’d get absorbed by skin. Too low (like 400 MHz), and my antenna would be huge. 
### Why a coaxial antenna? 
This was the first major design decision I had to make. A coaxial antenna is basically what you’d expect if an RF engineer designed a needle: a central conductor surrounded by a dielectric and an outer conductor. In microwave ablation, this design is **perfect for minimally invasive applications** because: 
* It's thin and needle-like 
* It supports a well-confined radiation pattern 
* It can be customized with slots or shapes to direct energy better 
The coaxial structure guides the microwave energy down to the **tip region**, and with the right design, it radiates strongly into surrounding tissue. But what causes heating isn't the antenna itself — it's the **oscillating electric field** it generates. 
### How does the antenna create thermal lesions? 
When the antenna is energized at 2.45 GHz, it produces a **time-varying electric field (E-field)** around the slots and tip. Biological tissue is lossy and conductive — this means the oscillating E-field causes **ionic movement and dielectric polarization** within the tissue. 
The result is **dielectric heating**, where energy from the field is converted into heat inside the tissue. This process is governed by the **SAR equation**: 
$$ SAR = \frac{\sigma |E|^2}{\rho}\$$ 
Where: 
* $$\sigma$$: tissue conductivity (how well it turns E-field into heat) 
* $$\|E| $$: electric field magnitude (produced by antenna) 
* $$\rho$$: tissue density 
The stronger and more concentrated the E-field, the more localized and intense the heating. 

### Mistake 1: I simulated the antenna in air 
When I first ran the simulation, I didn’t add any tissue around the antenna. It didn’t resonate, the fields looked weak, and SAR was basically zero. Turns out, this thing is designed to radiate **in lossy tissue**, not air. Once I embedded it inside a tissue phantom, the magic started happening. 

### Why are we even calculating SAR? 
Because SAR is **the starting point of thermal damage**. It tells us where the energy is going, and **how much of it** is absorbed by the tissue. Without SAR, we have no idea if the antenna is doing anything useful. Once we know the SAR, we can calculate temperature rise (with tissue properties and exposure time) and then assess whether the tissue gets hot enough to cause ablation. 

### Why dual slots? 
Single-slot antennas work, but **dual-slot designs improve field symmetry and distribute energy more uniformly** around the shaft. Instead of focusing all heating in one direction (like a spotlight), dual slots act like stereo speakers for microwaves — they surround the tumor with more even coverage. It also helps make the **ablation zone more spherical**, which is clinically preferred. 
Also, think of the slots as **pressure valves** for the field. Without them, the wave would either continue propagating down the coax or reflect backward. The slots give the wave a place to escape — **they minimize backscatter by bleeding energy outward into the tissue at the right impedance point**. This not only helps with efficiency but also controls where the field is released. It’s directional energy leakage — but on purpose. 

### Why should the slots be inside the tumor? 
So yes, ideally **you want the power-dumping slots inside the tumor**, but some leakage near the boundary might unintentionally help with matching — depending on how you've tuned the slot size and location. 
This one's critical. The **slots are the leakage points** — where microwave energy exits the antenna. If the slots are inside the tumor, you're **dumping energy directly into cancerous tissue**. If they’re too shallow (still in healthy tissue), you end up damaging the wrong area. Too deep? You might miss the tumor altogether. 
Slots are placed based on: 
* The depth of the tumor 
* The desired heating pattern 
* Antenna calibration for field symmetry
  
### Mistake 2: I forgot to subtract the antenna volume from the tissue 
At one point, my SAR plot looked weird and patchy. Then I realized: I hadn't subtracted the antenna from the tumor, so they were overlapping. HFSS didn't know which material to use. Once I did a proper Boolean subtract and reassigned materials, the SAR plot made sense.

### Where the heck did I get this idea? 
Funny story — I was reading *Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics* by Ulaby (yes, that textbook that everyone ignores the last chapters of), and there was a small section talking about how antennas can be used to generate heat to treat tumors. That one sentence stuck with me. I was like, "Wait... what? Antennas? Heat? Tumors?" 
Naturally, I did what any curious person would do — I started Googling. That led me to a bunch of IEEE papers on microwave ablation. One in particular described a dual-slot coaxial antenna for liver tumor ablation [LINK](https://www.ursi.org/proceedings/procAT22/ATAPRASC2022-papers/6NZ6DB5JNB.pdf). That paper didn’t just answer my question — it turned into the basis of this whole project. 
Think of the slots like windows on the side of the antenna — the electromagnetic energy escapes through them and focuses on the nearby tissue. This creates a **more spherical and controlled ablation zone**, and reduces unwanted heating of surrounding healthy stuff. I thought, "damn, this is clever." So naturally, I had to build it myself. 

### Dielectric Loss and σ: How They Affect Heating 
A quick technical sidebar: biological tissues have dielectric properties — mainly their **relative permittivity (εr)** and **conductivity (σ)**. High εr affects wave speed and wavelength inside tissue. High σ means more energy gets absorbed and converted to heat. That's exactly what tumors do best — soak up microwaves like a sponge. Add in **loss tangent** (tanδ = σ / (ωε)) and you’ve got a measure of how lossy the tissue is. More loss = more heating = better ablation. 

### Blood Perfusion: The Cooling We Often Ignore 
Here’s the thing most EM-only simulations miss — real tissue isn’t just sitting there passively heating up. **Blood flow constantly carries heat away**, acting like an internal cooling system. This means that even if you hit 60°C in a simulation, the actual tissue may stay cooler in reality unless you account for perfusion. Liver, especially, has a high blood perfusion rate, which makes it harder to maintain thermal dose — unless your energy is super focused. 
### Thermal Thresholds by Tissue Type 
Not all tissues die the same way. Muscle and liver tissue typically need to be held at **60°C for at least 1 minute** to ensure irreversible damage. But even **43°C** is enough to begin causing stress and protein denaturation if held long enough. That’s where CEM43 shines — it integrates both temperature and time into a single metric clinicians use to validate safe and effective ablation. 


### Step 1: Antenna design (in HFSS) 
I designed a **60 mm long coaxial line** in HFSS, with a **3 mm tall conical tip**. I kept the inner conductor radius at 0.1 mm, and the outer conductor at 0.43 mm (same as the paper). Then I added **two rectangular slots** on the outer conductor: 
* Each slot was 0.6 mm wide 
* They were spaced 9.2 mm apart 
* The first slot was 1.5 mm from the tip

**Figure 1.** *(a)* Full-length side view of the coaxial microwave ablation antenna showing its overall structure and slot positions. *(b)* Cross-sectional view illustrating the inner conductor (orange), dielectric layer, and outer conductor. *(c)* Longitudinal section revealing internal geometry, dual-slot configuration, and the conical radiating tip. *(d)* Antenna embedded within a tissue phantom, demonstrating insertion depth and slot placement relative to the tumor region.

### Mistake 3: Wrong cone size 
Originally, I gave the cone tip only 1 mm height — way too small to radiate efficiently in tissue. The fields looked weak, and SAR dropped off fast. Then I bumped it up to 3 mm, and things started looking better.
But the real breakthrough happened when I increased the cone length to 6 mm. Suddenly, my S₁₁ dropped to –20 dB, which is basically a chef’s kiss in matching. That means only about 1% of the power is getting reflected — the rest is going right into the tumor.

This change also caused a resonant frequency shift to 2.25 GHz, which makes sense — increasing the cone length effectively increased the electrical length of the antenna, nudging the resonance lower. Honestly, I’ll take the shift any day if it means better matching and stronger, more efficient heating.

**Figure 2.** Simulated return loss (S₁₁) of the coaxial microwave ablation antenna in lossy tissue. A deep resonance is observed at **2.2469 GHz** with **–20.15 dB** reflection, indicating excellent impedance matching and efficient power transfer into tissue.

### Step 2: Embedding it into a tumor 
So I created a **tumor sphere** (30 mm diameter) and inserted the antenna tip right into the center. Around that, I added a larger **liver sphere** to simulate the surrounding healthy tissue. I assigned realistic dielectric properties (tumor: εr = 55, σ = 1.99; liver: εr = 43, σ = 1.69), set everything to "Solve Inside", and ran the simulation at **2.45 GHz**. 

### Step 3: SAR — how much energy gets absorbed? 
SAR (Specific Absorption Rate) tells us **how much energy the tissue is absorbing**. I plotted SAR along a line from the antenna tip into the tumor. It looked amazing — the energy peaked right where I wanted it. 
I tested it for durations of **60, 120, 300, and 600 seconds** using MATLAB, with this simplified equation:

\$T(t) = T\_0 + \frac{\text{SAR} \cdot t}{\rho c}\$ 
Where: 
* T₀ = 37°C (body temp) 
* ρ = 1060 kg/m³ (density) 
* c = 3600 J/kg·K (specific heat) 
> **Bonus:** I also plotted the **temperature rise along a line** for different durations (60, 120, 300, and 600 seconds). This showed how heat stays concentrated near the antenna tip and falls off steeply beyond 5 mm — great for localized therapy.

![SAR1](/RF_blog/assets/images/SAR1.png)

**Figure 4.** Simulated temperature rise along a radial line from the antenna tip, calculated from average SAR at different exposure durations. At 600 seconds, temperatures exceed **50 °C** within the first 4–5 mm — well above the thermal damage threshold. The **safe tissue temperature limit (45 °C)** is shown in cyan. Shorter durations (60–300 s) still cause significant heating near the tip, with thermal penetration decreasing as distance increases.

### Mistake 4: Plotting SAR on the wrong object 
At first, I couldn't see my SAR plot. Turns out, I had selected the antenna surface instead of the tissue when assigning SAR calculations. Rookie mistake. Once I selected the correct tissue object (tumor), it all worked.

![SAR3](/RF_blog/assets/images/SAR3.png)
**Figure 5.** 3D SAR field distribution (W/kg) inside the tissue phantom at 2.2469 GHz. Maximum SAR observed is **410.7 W/kg**, with strong energy deposition concentrated near the antenna tip and slot regions. The color scale illustrates how electromagnetic energy is absorbed within tissue, with peak heating localized to the tumor zone.

### Step 4: CEM43 — is it actually dead? 
Just because a spot gets hot doesn't mean it dies. That's where **CEM43** comes in (Cumulative Equivalent Minutes at 43°C). It’s a way to quantify how lethal the heating is: 
* CEM43 > 240 minutes = thermal damage guaranteed 
I calculated this in MATLAB too, using:
 
```matlab 
for i = 1:(t_total / dt) 
R = ones(size(T)); 
R(T >= 43) = 0.5; 
R(T < 43) = 0.25; 
CEM43 = CEM43 + dt * (R .^ (43 - T)); 
end 
``` 
![SAR2](/RF_blog/assets/images/SAR2.png)

**Figure 6.** CEM43 vs. distance along a radial line from the antenna tip after 300 seconds of exposure. The CEM43 value exceeds **1000 minutes** at the tip and drops below the ablation threshold of **240 minutes** around **5.5 mm**, indicating the effective thermal damage zone. The steep falloff ensures a focused ablation region with minimal impact on surrounding tissue.

The results? The CEM43 passed 240 within 5.5 mm of the tip after 5 minutes. We’re not just heating tissue — we’re cooking it to clinical standards. 
### Step 5: What if we don't insert anything at all? 
Here’s a thought: can we ablate a tumor **without inserting** anything? Like, just place the antenna outside the body and direct energy through the skin into the tumor? 
That’s going to be my next project.

### What I learned 
* A simple conical tip + dual-slot coaxial antenna can create a precise, deep ablation zone. 
* You need tissue models to get real results — air doesn’t cut it. 
* SAR is nice, but **CEM43 is what matters** clinically. 
* With MATLAB + HFSS, you can simulate and visualize the whole therapy process. 
* Mistakes are expected — each one helped refine the setup.
  
### What’s next? 
* Simulate skin/fat/muscle layers for non-invasive MWA and explore how ablation behaves across different tissues 
* Try 915 MHz for deeper heating and tissue selectivity 
* Compare thermal damage progression: is it necrosis or apoptosis? (Hint: above 60°C it's usually irreversible tissue death) 
* Run side-by-side comparisons between microwave, RF, and laser ablation — spoiler: microwaves heat faster, deeper, and with fewer electrodes 
* Experiment with multi-slot geometries or phased designs to shape the ablation zone 
* Animate time-evolution of temperature rise 
If you're curious to replicate or expand on this, I modeled everything in ANSYS HFSS. If you want the files, just shoot me an email — I’ll gladly share!
