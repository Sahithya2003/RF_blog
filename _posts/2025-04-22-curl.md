Have you ever wondered how electric and magnetic fields behave — not just in theory, but in real space? Maxwell’s equations are the four elegant rules that describe all of classical electromagnetism, yet they often feel abstract. This blog aims to change that.

We'll explore divergence, curl, and each of Maxwell’s equations — not just through equations, but through visuals and animations. Whether you're a student, a physics enthusiast, or a curious engineer, this guide will help you see the invisible forces that shape our technology and universe.

## Section 1: Curl — The Field That Spins

### What is Curl?

Curl tells us how much a vector field tends to rotate around a point.  
It’s like asking: “If I place a tiny paddle wheel here, will it spin?”

- If curl ≠ 0, there's rotation (like a whirlpool).
- If curl = 0, the field flows straight — no spinning.

### Real-World Analogy:

Imagine you’re in a river:
- If the water flows straight → your boat just drifts = zero curl.
- If you hit a whirlpool → your boat spins = non-zero curl.

Same goes for magnetic fields.  
A current-carrying wire makes magnetic field lines curl around it — literally described by:
\[
\nabla \times \vec{B} = \mu_0 \vec{J}
\]
